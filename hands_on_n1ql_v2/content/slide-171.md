## <b> Part 8 : INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE and MERGE Statements </b>

N1QL provides several data modification statements.  

 * Insert
 * Delete
 * Update
 * Upsert
 * Merge

 In the N1QL DML statements DELETE, UPDATE and MERGE the LIMIT clause 
 serves as a hint. The query engine can stop processing records any 
 time after the LIMIT is reached. The LIMIT is not applied exactly, 
 which is different from SELECT statements.
